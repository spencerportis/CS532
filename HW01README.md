1.)Save the file to a location using your IDE first.  
2.)Compile the code using the clang gcc function 
            gcc -o hw1 sportis_hw1.c
3.)Navigate to the location the .c file is located and the executeable should be in the same location.  
4.)Run the executable.  

There are two functions, UABIndexSum and primeOrFactorial.  UABIndexSum takes creates an 1D array out of an inputted number and asks the user to input values for each indice.  If the location of an indice matches the value of the indice, the two numbers are added together.  The sum of all of these matching indexes is then displayed to the user.  primeOrFactorial takes a user input and determines if the number is prime.  If the number is not prime, the factorial of that number is displayed.
